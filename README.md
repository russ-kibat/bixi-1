BIXI is the non-profit organization tasked with managing the city of Montreal’s public bike system. Created in 2014, Bixi manages 9,500 bikes and over 700 stations. As a part of the public transit solution for the city it offers bikes to every member of the public on a pay-per-use basis. They also offer seasonal and monthly memberships for dedicated users of the service. 

My initial task is to review data from the 2016 and 2017 seasons to discover insights and gain an understanding of usage patterns using SQL and visualizations using G-Suite. The next phase of the project will utilize Tableau to create visualizations and answer questions may be posed by Bixi’s management team. Intuitively, weather can play a role in bike usage and upon collecting historical weather data for Montreal, I intend to model how daily weather affects bike usage in a third post. 

The data from the 2016 and 2017 seasons offers insights into seasonal usage demand, inbound/outbound traffic patterns, and the types of trips people are taking on BIXI bikes. I highlight growth between in the 2017 season and seasonal changes in usage by non-members to make a data-driven recommendation for a promotional campaign. I then analyze traffic for a particularly popular station and look at where users are using bikes for leisure rides rather than commuting.

The data  provided to me for this project has been cleaned and was obtained from the open data portal at [Bixi Montreal](https://www.bixi.com/en/open-data)
